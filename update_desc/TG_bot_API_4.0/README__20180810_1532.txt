Last night was the first time I am aware of the thumb parameter. Its addition requires me to cram one more file to the call to _api_request_with_file(), whose original version is this:

def _api_request_with_file(self, method, params, file_key, file_value, **kwargs):
    if _isstring(file_value):
        params[file_key] = file_value
        return self._api_request(method, _rectify(params), **kwargs)
    else:
        files = {file_key: file_value}
        return self._api_request(method, _rectify(params), files, **kwargs)

Bot API allows file_value to be either a string (serving as a file id which refers to an existing file on Telegram servers) or a local file to be uploaded. That's why I have to distinguish between file_value being a string or not above. If it is a string, merge it to params. If not a string, I assume it's a file and pass it separately. Note that variable files is a dict.

Now, I want _api_request_with_file() to be able to handle multiple files. I would squeeze file_key and file_value into one parameter of dict:

def _api_request_with_file(self, method, params, files, **kwargs):
    params.update({
        k:v for k,v in files.items() if _isstring(v) })

    files = {
        k:v for k,v in files.items() if v is not None and not _isstring(v) }

    return self._api_request(method, _rectify(params), files, **kwargs)

I hate sprinkling trivial comments among code, so I explain here:

    params.update({ k:v for k,v in files.items() if _isstring(v) }) basically extracts all string values from files and merges them with params
    files = { k:v for k,v in files.items() if v is not None and not _isstring(v) } basically extracts all non-null non-string values from files and reassigns them to the variable files

With this change to _api_request_with_file() and the addition of the thumb parameter, sendAnimation should looks like this:

def sendAnimation(self, chat_id, animation,
                  duration=None,
                  width=None,
                  height=None,
                  thumb=None,
                  caption=None,
                  parse_mode=None,
                  disable_notification=None,
                  reply_to_message_id=None,
                  reply_markup=None):
    """
    See: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendanimation

    :param video: Same as ``photo`` in :meth:`telepot.Bot.sendPhoto`
    """
    p = _strip(locals(), more=['animation', 'thumb'])
    return self._api_request_with_file('sendAnimation',
                                       _rectify(p),
                                       {'animation': animation, 'thumb': thumb})

If you don't mind being a bit venturesome, let me suggest one more change regarding the function _strip(). Instead of simply removing certain parameters from locals(), I want it to package them into a separate dict, so I can pass it directly.

Originally:

def _strip(params, more=[]):
    return {key: value for key,value in params.items() if key not in ['self']+more}

I would change it to:

def _strip(params, files=[]):
    return (
        { k:v for k,v in params.items() if k not in ['self']+files },
        { k:v for k,v in params.items() if k in files })

Then, sendAnimation becomes:

def sendAnimation(self, chat_id, animation,
                  duration=None,
                  width=None,
                  height=None,
                  thumb=None,
                  caption=None,
                  parse_mode=None,
                  disable_notification=None,
                  reply_to_message_id=None,
                  reply_markup=None):
    """
    See: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendanimation

    :param video: Same as ``photo`` in :meth:`telepot.Bot.sendPhoto`
    """
    p,f = _strip(locals(), files=['animation', 'thumb'])
    return self._api_request_with_file('sendAnimation', _rectify(p), _rectify(f))

Remember to add thumb parameter to all other relevant methods. For example, sendVideo should look like:

def sendVideo(self, chat_id, video,
              duration=None,
              width=None,
              height=None,
              thumb=None,
              caption=None,
              parse_mode=None,
              supports_streaming=None,
              disable_notification=None,
              reply_to_message_id=None,
              reply_markup=None):
    """
    See: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendvideo

    :param video: Same as ``photo`` in :meth:`telepot.Bot.sendPhoto`
    """
    p,f = _strip(locals(), files=['video', 'thumb'])
    return self._api_request_with_file('sendVideo', _rectify(p), _rectify(f))

Because of the change to _strip's return value, all calls to it should be re-examined and changed to:

p,f = _strip(locals())

Please also note that none of the above has been tested, although I am confident that they should not be far off.

There are more changes to be made. Let's continue some time later. Good luck.
